# REST API Blog using MERN Stack and JWT as means of authentication

## A fully functional example project that leverages MERN Stack, JWT autentication and deployment in Render

This project arose as an assignment along the curriculum provided by the site [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), where the main interest of the application is to implement a REST API to communicate the client (React) and the server (Express). Also, the application employs JWT (JsonWebToken) to provide the owner with authentication and to grant operations that involve:

* Blog creation.
* Editing or deleting Posts.
* Deleting comments from other users.

Each section of this project is sample code that illustrates how to do the following:

* Structure the folders of the application.
* Define API controllers and route.
* The use of the fetch function to bridge the gap between React and the server.
* Implement JWT to grant stateless authentication.
